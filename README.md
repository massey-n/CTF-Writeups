# CTF-Writeups
All of my writeups for CTFs

This will likely be full of OverTheWire, HackTheBox, and TryHackMe writeups. My goal is to make a writeup for each challenge I complete, so the list will grow a lot over time. I'm very much still learning, so if anything doesn't look right, don't hesitate to let me know!

Each writeup is focused on learning, rather than giving away passwords. I'll include commands, core concepts, and things I got hung up on, with a focus on understanding how and why these things work. My goal is to fully master each challenge so that I can explain my process clearly and concisely, and hopefully aid you on your journey.

Please reach out if this was helpful to you, if you'd like to compare notes, or if you think I got something wrong! Feedback = Motivation = More Writeups. I know you want more writeups.

Have a lovely day and happy keyboard-mashing!
